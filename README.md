## This is a simple and small 'i-pod' based react app. You can check it out here: https://i-pod-iota.vercel.app/ (deployed via Vercel app)

## This is how it will look, when you click on the link. The upper portion is 'Screen' and bottom portion has 'Controls'.

## I've used Zingtouch package on 'Controls-section'.

## To use it:
1. You need to left click on the mouse and then drag in 'Circular-controls-section'. 
2. You can select the option with circular button in center.
3. To go back to home screen, click on 'MENU'.


## To run this on your system:
1. Clone the project.
2. Run 'npm install' to install the dependent packages.
3. Run 'npm start' to run the project on your system.

### Happy Coding!
